# restaurant-ims
This is my inventory management system (IMS) for a restaurant project. It will be made as a Maven project and will contain CRUD functionality, connecting via JDBC with adherence to OOP best practice and will also be rigurously tested using JUnit. This is the project management board: https://supercreativename.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/BSE/boards/1

This is the fist ERD I have created and will be used as the foundations for my project.
